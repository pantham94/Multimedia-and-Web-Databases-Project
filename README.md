# Multimedia-and-Web-Databases-Project
Understanding the techniques to store multimedia data, which is inherently heterogeneous in nature, has been a challenging task. Additionally, storage and retrieval in multimedia databases often involves comparing objects that are similar to each other. To address this task, the initial portion of the project focuses on understanding various distance measures between two videos.Further, this project involves multiple concepts identifying the distance between two videos in terms  of  their  frames, using   features  such  as  histogram similarity,  SIFT vectors  and  motion vectors to compute overall similarity, usage of k-nearest neighbors to identify the objects that are the closest in terms of the similarity and a dimensionality reduction technique called Principal Component   Analysis.   PCA   forms   an   important   component   which   relates   to   the   idea   of dimensionality reduction. This concept involves the need for understanding the Dimensionality curse that can result when the video we have has too many dimensions to perform effective feature extraction. Gaining an understanding of key concepts such as similarity between objects and feature extraction helps to describe how different multimedia objects could potentially be stored and effectively retrieved from databases.
